# UN-VEIL — Unmasking Virtual Entities & Intelligence Linkage

> **Evidence-Locked Temporal Attribution for Dark-Web Intelligence**  
> *National Cyber Threat Attribution & Forensic Evidence Intelligence Portal*  
> *Project SIH-26151 (NTRO, Blockchain & Cybersecurity)*

## 1. Project Overview

**UN-VEIL** is a national-grade cyber intelligence and digital forensics platform designed for investigative analysts. It correlates pseudonymous dark-web threat actors across Tor hidden services, cryptographic keys, blockchain ledgers, infrastructure footprints, and stylometric writeprints.

The system enforces an **evidence-first analytical philosophy**:
- **Collection ≠ Attribution:** Raw ingestion preserves forensic evidence without premature conclusions.
- **Explainability (WHY Engine):** Every suggested attribution link exposes its exact supporting evidence, independent corroboration channels, temporal migration window, and forensic provenance.
- **Formal Analytical Abstention:** When evidence is conflicting, incomplete, or ambiguous, the platform formally **abstains** from declaring attribution rather than forcing a false verdict.
- **Read-Only Agentic Orchestration:** AI assistance is strictly confined to read-only task planning and evidence gap identification; attribution verdicts are reserved for the deterministic fusion policy and human analyst review.
